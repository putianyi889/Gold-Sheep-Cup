# WoM rewards for GSC

From the 9th GSC, [Minesweeper Online](https://minesweeper.online/) resources are added to the pool to bring more motivation and attract international players. Anyone can sponsor GSC by donating resources to an [official account](https://minesweeper.online/player/5619613). Any kind of resources are accepted while different resources apply different allocating rules. 

## Allocation rules
All resources fall into one of the following categories:
- Currency: coins and gems. The prices of gems are relatively stable so we can do conversions. Currently, 1 gem = 395 coins.
- Floating-value items: tickets and equips.

The allocation start from the top players (in terms of T.37). Every player can pick either currency or **one** floating-value item. The amount of currency the player can get is calculated as follows:

- The 1st can get the maximum between 200k or 5% of total currency pool. We calculate the ratio `p` by `p = (top prize)/pool`. For example, if the pool is 2M, then p=10%. If the pool is 5M, then the top prize is 250k and p=5%.
- The following players can get up to `p*(remaining pool)`, rounded up. For example, if the pool is 2M and the first player takes 200k, then the second player can take up to 1.8M\*10%=180k. If the first player takes an equipment instead, then the second player can take up to 200k. Taking less than what you can get or taking a floating-value item will affect everyone downstream.

The official account will contact the player in turn via Minesweeper Online. The player needs to send an exchange to the official account to claim their rewards. If a player doesn't do this in 24 hours, they will be "hanged up". When they return later by replying to the official account, their status will become "back" and will be called after a reward is successfully allocated. For example, suppose the queue is `A->B->C`. The official account contacts A first but A doesn't respond in 24 hours, then the official account turns to B. Suppose that A comes back when B is pending. If B takes their rewards, A will be the next to pick rewards. If B also doesn't respond in time and is hanged up, A will need to wait for C's decision, etc.

If two players are both back after being hanged up, they will be called in the order of their ranking. After we reach the end of ranking, we start to call those who are back. Then all hanged-up players have 1 chance in 1 week to get an equip or a ticket by sending an exchange to the official account. The exchanges will be accepted by the order of their indices. For example, if two players hit the same single item, only the exchange with smaller index will pass while the other will be discarded, meaning that one player will get nothing. After the week, the allocation is over and the pool is open for donation.

PS: Players who are willing to get rewards on WoM need to be able to use basic WoM features. We will not teach you how to send an exchange, etc. If you don't know how to use WoM, then you should not get WoM rewards.

## The prize pool
The prize pool is maintained [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uP6P3oERcd_POmXP8-vP2Yl0VrIyVny9mmegvZxx2-A/edit?usp=sharing) by [Tian-Yi Pu](https://minesweepergame.com/profile.php?pid=8747). It's closed at the start of an GSC and reopened after the [allocation process](#allocation-rules). You can still send exchanges during the closed period and we will accept them once the pool is reopened.

Remaining resources after a GSC will be reserved for the next one.

We don't accept trades.

# 金羊杯的WoM资源奖励

从第9届金羊杯开始，为了提高参赛积极性、吸引国际选手，选手们可以获取[Minesweeper Online](https://minesweeper.online/)的资源奖励。任何人都可以通过向[官方账号](https://minesweeper.online/player/5619613)捐赠的方式赞助金羊杯。我们接受任何种类的资源。不同的资源遵循不同的分配规则。

## 奖励发放规则
所有资源分为两大类：
- 货币：金币和宝石。宝石的市场价相对稳定，可以做转换。当前1宝石=395金币。
- 不定价物品：门票和装备。

奖励依照T.37成绩排名顺序发放。每位选手都可以选择领取货币或**一件**不定价物品。一名选手可以领取的货币上限算法如下：
- 第一名可以领取20万（当奖池<400万）或5%的奖池（当奖池>400万）。发放比例的计算公式是`p=第一名奖励/总奖池`。例如，当奖池有200万时，第一名可领取20万，p=10%；当奖池有500万时，第一名可领取25万，p=5%。
- 每名后续选手可以领取至多`p*剩余奖池`的货币，向上取整。例如，假设总奖池有200万，第一名拿了20万，则第二名可以拿180万\*10%=18万。如果第一名选择了拿装备，则第二名可以拿20万。你的每个选择都会对后续的所有选手能获得的奖金/物品造成影响。

比赛成绩公布后，官方账号会依次在Minesweeper Online私聊选手。被叫到选手需要在24小时内发送交易选取奖励，否则将被“挂起”。选手被挂起后，回复任何内容，状态会转变为“等待”，会在成功发放一个奖励后被叫到。例如，假设排名是`A->B->C`，官方账号先联系A，但是A未能在24小时内领奖，则官方账号会去联系B。如果在B的奖励发放过程中A回来了，那么在B成功领取奖励后就会轮到A。如果B也没在24小时内领奖，则A需要等待C的奖励发放……

如果有多位处于“等待”状态的选手，他们被叫到的顺序以排名为准。当最后一名的奖励发放过程结束后（无论最后一名是否领奖），官方账号会开始依次联系所有处于“等待”状态的选手。这一步骤完成后，所有处于“挂起”状态的选手有一星期的时间通过发送交易的方式申请领取一件不定价物品（不能领取货币）。这些申请会依照交易编号先后顺序执行。若多名选手选中了同一件物品，则只有最先提交的申请会被通过，后续申请都将作废，对应的选手也就失去了获得奖励的资格。

注：想要领取WoM奖励的选手需要能够使用Minesweeper Online的基础功能。我们不会教你如何发送交易等等。如果你不会用Minesweeper Online，那就不应领取WoM奖励。

## 关于奖池
[奖池](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uP6P3oERcd_POmXP8-vP2Yl0VrIyVny9mmegvZxx2-A/edit?usp=sharing)由[濮天羿](https://minesweepergame.com/profile.php?pid=8747)维护。为了照顾到中国大陆的玩家，奖池还在[腾讯文档](https://docs.qq.com/sheet/DYUJVYUZubnJHVmtj)做了镜像，但是该镜像很少更新。奖池的捐赠通道于金羊杯开始时关闭，于奖励发放结束后打开。您仍可以在奖池关闭期间发送交易，我们会在奖池打开后第一时间接收。

一届金羊杯未发放完成的奖励会顺延到下一届。

奖池不接受交换资源的交易。
